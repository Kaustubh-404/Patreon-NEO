# Neotron: A Decentralized Patreon on NEO

**Neotron** is a decentralized platform built on the NEO blockchain that empowers creators to receive direct support from their fans without intermediaries. By leveraging blockchain technology, Neotron ensures secure, transparent, and fee-less transactions for creators and supporters, providing a fair and efficient way for creators to monetize their work.

## üîó Project Overview

Neotron allows creators to receive **Gas Tokens** directly from supporters, bypassing traditional intermediaries and centralized platforms that take significant cuts from creator earnings. Built with user-friendliness and transparency in mind, Neotron fosters a direct connection between creators and supporters, ensuring that creators retain full control over their income.

## üí° Key Features

- **Decentralized Platform**: Built on the NEO blockchain, ensuring transactions are secure, transparent, and censorship-resistant.
- **Direct Support**: Fans can send Gas Tokens directly to creators without intermediaries, reducing costs and delays.
- **No Platform Fees**: Creators receive their full earnings, minus only minimal Gas transaction fees.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Designed to be user-friendly for both creators and supporters, lowering the barrier to entry for blockchain-based support platforms.
- **Security & Transparency**: All transactions and interactions are securely recorded on the blockchain, allowing for full transparency.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Creator Account**: Creators can easily sign up on the Neotron platform.
2. **Support**: Fans send Gas Tokens directly to their favorite creators‚Äô accounts.
3. **Earnings**: Creators can withdraw their funds at any time directly into their NEO wallets.
4. **Transparency**: Supporters can track their contributions, ensuring their support goes directly to the creator without any hidden fees or intermediaries.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: NEO Blockchain ‚Äì for decentralized, secure transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity ‚Äì for handling creator support and earnings withdrawal, deployed on the NEO X testnet.
- **Data Indexing**: The Graph ‚Äì used to index and query transaction data for transparent interaction history.
- **Frontend**: React ‚Äì providing an intuitive and modern user interface for both creators and supporters.

## üìä Current Progress

### What is Done:
- **Smart Contracts**: Developed using **Solidity**, deployed on the **NEO X testnet**, and managing all transactions between supporters and creators. The contracts ensure secure, immutable, and transparent transfers of Gas Tokens.
- **Subgraphs with The Graph**: Implemented subgraphs to efficiently index and query all transaction data on the platform. This ensures real-time transparency for both creators and supporters.
- **UI/UX Development**: A user-friendly interface is designed for seamless interaction between creators and fans.
- **Direct Support System**: Built the core functionality for sending Gas Tokens directly from supporters to creators.

### What Could Have Been Done:
- **Tiered Subscription Model**: Currently, the platform allows for single transactions. Implementing a system for tiered subscriptions (e.g., bronze, silver, gold supporters) could enhance creator monetization.
- **NFT Integration**: As a bonus feature, NFTs could have been implemented to allow creators to offer digital collectibles to their supporters, adding another revenue stream.

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

### Near-Term:
- **Tiered Support Levels**: Adding a subscription model where fans can support creators monthly at different levels, unlocking exclusive content based on their contribution tier.
- **Advanced Analytics for Creators**: Building detailed analytics dashboards to help creators track their performance and supporters‚Äô activity.
- **Improved Documentation**: Strengthen and update the documentation, ensuring more clarity for new developers looking to contribute to the platform.

### Long-Term:
- **Cross-Chain Support**: Integrate with other blockchains (such as Ethereum, Solana, or Polygon) to give creators and supporters flexibility in the type of assets they can use.
- **Community Building Features**: Enable creators to engage with their supporters more actively by offering community-building tools such as messaging and exclusive content delivery directly through the platform.
- **Governance**: Implement a decentralized governance model to allow creators and supporters to vote on platform improvements, new features, and future developments.
- **Gasless Transactions**: Explore options to introduce gasless transactions for supporters, lowering barriers to entry for fans not familiar with blockchain technology.

## üèÜ Hackathon Submission

**Neotron** has been submitted to the hackathon under the following bounties:
1. **NEO Blockchain**: Utilizing NEO for decentralized creator-fan support with secure Gas Token transactions.
2. **Solidity Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts deployed on the **NEO X testnet** to handle creator support and earnings.
3. **The Graph**: Leveraging subgraphs to index and query transaction data, providing transparency and real-time tracking.

---

## üí¨ Feedback and Future Improvements

**Positives**:
- The use of NEO and Gas Tokens ensures a low-cost, high-efficiency platform.
- The integration with The Graph provides real-time data access, ensuring transparency for all users.
- Solidity allows for secure and efficient smart contract development on the NEO blockchain.

**Areas for Improvement**:
- The documentation for NEO and its developer tools is somewhat outdated and lacking in detail. Improving the documentation could make it easier for new developers to build on this platform.
- The project could benefit from additional features such as tiered subscriptions and NFTs for creators to enhance engagement and monetization.
